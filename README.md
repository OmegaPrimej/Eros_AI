# Eros_AI
ErosAI simulates erotic emotions, exploring intimacy and human connection through AI. Integrating NLP, computer vision, and cognitive architectures to create a nuanced emotional experience.
Let's recap and rebuild. I'll provide a README file and guide you through the process. Here's a starting point:

README.md

ErosAI
 Simulates human emotions and intimacy
 Modular design for flexibility and control
 Python-based, using TensorFlow and NLTK

Directory Structure

 eros_ai/
 main.py
 neural_network.py
 nlp.py
 computer_vision.py
 cognitive_architecture.py
 data/
 emotions.csv
 intimacy.csv
 visual_data.csv
 models/
 neural_network_model.h5
 nlp_model.pkl
 computer_vision_model.h5

Here are the files and code you need to build ErosAI. I'll provide the `neural_network.py` file first, and then you'll receive a list of all the necessary files. 

`neural_network.py`:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class NeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = keras.Sequential()

    def init(self):
        self.model.compile()

    def run(self):
        # Run the neural network
        pass
```

Here is the list of files you'll need:

* `main.py`
* `neural_network.py`
* `nlp.py`
* `computer_vision.py`
* `cognitive_architecture.py`
* `data/emotions.csv`
* `data/intimacy.csv`
* `data/visual_data.csv`
* `models/neural_network_model.h5`
* `models/nlp_model.pkl`
* `models/computer_vision_model.h5`
* `requirements.txt`

Here's the next step. I'll provide the `nlp.py` file, which includes the natural language processing module.

`nlp.py`:
```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

class NLP:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

    def process_text(self, text):
        # Process the text using NLP
        pass
```
